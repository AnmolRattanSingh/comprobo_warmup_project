Tried to check angle 135 and 45 first and make them equal distance to try and follow the wall. Then realized that I need to do math to actually make the angles 45. Use trig or smth.

Drive square tried first with timed driving and turns. Added random sleep times first 1, 0.5s. Then realized need to do math for turning time. Then realized exact math not ideal since it takes
some time to accelerate. Then added random constant about 0.09 to account for that. Better solution could be used. Teleop was pretty easy to implement. Have a goal to make it record key holds and do video game like driving mechanics.
